# time-series-exercises
### About the Module
 - In this module, you will learn why, when, and how to employ forecasting methods for predicting temporal events, i.e. events that occur over time. You will learn how to evaluate and improve performance of the model. You will understand the differences in stats based, or parametric, and machine learning based, or non-parametric methods.

1. We will acquire data via: a REST API, Cloud File Storage (AWS-S3), and SQL.
2. We will practice using pandas to operate on dates and datetime values
3. We will address some of the complexities of time series data, including seasonality, sampling, and storing.
4. We will create forecasts, or time series models, using Simple Average, Moving Average, Holts Linear Trend, and Prophet, and Autoregressive model.
5. We will practice forecasting sales (store/items sales data) and learn techniques for working with with time series data like logs (user behavior) or other financial measurements over time.
